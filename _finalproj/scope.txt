boy i love video games

Game: 
shoot em up style game with an influence of mmo style mechanics on its gameplay to deviate from a standard shmup. standard shmups are generally bullet patterns you read and dodge accordingly, whereas MMO mechanics tend to be more of a puzzle for players to execute solutions for. 

For reference:
rabbit&steel trailer - a game recently released in spring 2024 with an identical goal.

What I'd like to implement:
* a player that moves around and shoots bullets on command
	- needs HP + hitbox
	- would like to maybe implement some sort of resource management (TBD) 
* a series of stages with a boss with mechanics tied to the boss
	- boss needs visible HP bar
	- boss needs hitbox (affected by player bullets)
	- individual stages have specific environments for the player, but certain UI elements are constant regardless of stage
* hurting objects (AOES, boss bullets, whatever)
	- needs a hurt box 
	- not sure where in the chain of affiliations this should go (eg stage or boss or unrelated object) 
	- will need to spawn and despawn these in patterns and in reaction to certain triggers
